The Providence Urbanist Network organizes area residents to promote more housing, greater density and mixed-use construction, and more non-car transportation options. Our membership includes renters and homeowners, students, workers, and retirees, people who donâ€™t have cars and those who rely heavily on cars for transportation. Outside of PUN, our members participate in a range of other community involvement.
