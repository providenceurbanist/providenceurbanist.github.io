RE: Use of thirty-one acres of vacant land near George Waterman Road to build a public safety municipal complex

Dear Mayor Polisena

We write today on behalf of Providence Urbanist Network to express our dismay at the announcement that you’ve decided to use the vacant land near George Waterman Road to build a public safety municipal complex. This a critical time for politicians like yourself to champion affordable housing projects to alleviate the housing crises in Rhode Island. 

We were surprised when you pledged to “use all the power of government” to fight an affordable housing project. By canceling this project, as well as canceling plans to build a new high school, you are not serving your residents. They believed in you to help Johnston grow and thrive. 60% voted for a $120 million housing bond, in recognition that more housing is a crucial need for Johnston. Public safety, public education, and this housing project need not be in conflict. Until this announcement, they were not. We don’t doubt the very real needs of public safety and municipal employees, which deserve serious consideration, rather than belated deployment as a shield against an affordable housing project.  

A municipal complex and technical school are not a substitute for a home. The results of canceling this project will be felt for generations. Even with a technical school, students still need housing, and a place to grow and set down roots in Johnston. 

Providence Urbanist Network recognizes that politicians have many complex and difficult choices to make for their city and state. Establishing long-term, affordable housing is a smart course for Johnston.  As advocates for more housing, Providence Urbanist Network supports projects not just in Providence, but believes everyone in Rhode Island deserves to live and thrive in their chosen home. Together we work for a better Rhode Island.

Please reconsider your position and don’t cancel this important housing project. 
Thank you for your continued leadership and consideration of this request. 

Sincerely,
The Providence Urbanist Network Steering Committee:<br>
